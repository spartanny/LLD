# Bowling Alley

Write machine code for a single-lane bowling alley system. One bowling game will be played by multiple players on a single lane. During the game, players and their scores will be maintained and shown by the system and the winner will be declared at the end of the game.&#x20;

Some rules about bowling:

● The Game of bowling consists of 5 Rounds.&#x20;

● Each round consists of alternate plays (one by each player), and each player will have two chances to drop all the “pins”&#x20;

● The score for a round is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.&#x20;

● A strike is when the player knocks down all ten pins on the first try. If there is a strike the player gets 10 bonus points.&#x20;

● A spare is when the player knocks down all ten pins in two tries. If there is spare the player gets 5 bonus points.&#x20;

● In the final round, a player who rolls a spare or a strike is allowed to roll extra 2 balls(not rounds) to complete the round. This allows for a potential of 7 strikes (5+2) in a single game.&#x20;

● Strike is denoted by ‘x’ and spare is denoted by ‘/’. All other pin drop count can be denoted by 0 - 9 (for ex: 5, if five pins were dropped in a round)&#x20;

● After the final round, display the Player list in ranked order on the basis of score. Bonus Point: (Only Attempt If Time Permits) Changing Bonus Rule: Bonus points are awarded, depending on what is scored in the next 2 balls (for a strike) or next 1 ball (for a spare).

Example: Below example is for 3 Rounds Input: Number of players: 2 Round 1: Enter Score for Player1 - Chance1: 8 Enter Score for Player1 - Chance2: 2

### Round 1:

Player1 Score Chance1 - 8pins Chance2 - 2pin

Scoreboard: P1: {8,/} -> 15 (10+5) P2: {} -> 0

Enter Score for Player2 - Chance1: 10

Player2 Score Chance1 - 10pins

Scoreboard: P1: {8,/} -> 15 P2: {X,} -> 20 (10+10)

***

### Round 2:&#x20;

Enter Score for Player1 - Chance1: 2 Enter Score for Player1 - Chance2: 7

Player1 Score Chance1 - 2pins Chance2 - 7pin

Scoreboard: P1: {8,/}, {2,7} -> 24 (15+9) P2: {X,}, {} -> 20

Enter Score for Player2 - Chance1: 6 Enter Score for Player2 - Chance2: 4

Player2 Score Chance1 - 6pins Chance2 - 4pin

Scoreboard: P1: {8,/}, {2,7} -> 24 P2: {X,}, {6,/} -> 35 (20+10+5)

***

### Round 3:&#x20;

Enter Score for Player1 - Chance1: 10 Enter Score for Player1 - Chance2: 8 Enter Score for Player1 - Chance3: 2

Player1 Score Chance1 - 10pins Player1 Score Chance2 - 8pins Chance3 - 2pin (Extra chance as all pins were dropped in last round)

Scoreboard: P1: {8,/}, {2,7}, {X,}, {8,/} -> 59 (24+(10+10)+(10+5)) P2: {X, }, {6, /}, {} -> 35

Enter Score for Player2 - Chance1: 3 Enter Score for Player2 - Chance2: 4

Player2 Score Chance1 - 3pins Chance2 - 4pin

Scoreboard: P1: {8,/}, {2,7}, {X, }, {8,/} -> 59 P2: {X, }, {6, /}, {3,4} -> 42 (35+3+4)

***

Final Output: P1 - 59 points (winner) P2 - 42 points Example for bonus question: Strike: Round 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike) Round 2, ball 1: 3 pins Round 2, ball 2: 6 pins The total score from these throws is: Round one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19 Round two: 3 + 6 = 9 TOTAL = 28 Spare: Round 1, ball 1: 7 pins Round 1, ball 2: 3 pins (spare) Round 2, ball 1: 4 pins Round 2, ball 2: 2 pins

The total score from these throws is: Round one: 7 + 3 + 4 (bonus) = 14 Round two: 4 + 2 = 6 TOTAL = 20
